**readdirplus** | **bool** | If true, readdirplus requests are enabled. | [optional] 
**readdirplus_prefetch** | **int** | This field is deprecated and does not do anything. | [optional] 
**return_32bit_file_ids** | **bool** | Limits the size of file identifiers returned by NFSv3+ to 32-bit values. | [optional] 
**root_clients** | **list[str]** | Clients that have root access to the export. | [optional]
